# Orchestrator

Orchestrator is a Kubernetes IDE designed for the GNOME desktop. Explore and
manage your clusters with a simple and intuitive interface. Equipped with
essential features such as a terminal for executing commands, monitoring through
logs and metrics, and a resource editor that conveniently places the API
reference at your fingertips.

## Download

Downloads for all platforms are available under
[releases](https://github.com/SilkePilon/Orchestrator/releases). On Linux, we
recommend using the Flatpak package.

## Features

### Cluster Management

- **Auto-discovery**: automatically detects kubeconfig files at `~/.kube/config`
  and any paths in `$KUBECONFIG`
- **Multiple clusters**: connect to and switch between multiple clusters from
  the welcome screen
- **Manual configuration**: configure clusters by host URL, bearer token, TLS
  certificates, or exec-based auth
- **Bootstrap new clusters**: install a fresh **k3s** cluster on remote
  SSH-reachable nodes through a guided wizard. Detects distro/package
  manager/firewall, generates an editable plan of every shell command that will
  run, streams live logs per node, and registers the resulting cluster in
  Orchestrator preferences on success.
- **Read-only mode**: optionally prevent any write operations against a cluster
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Ctrl+N` opens a new window, `Ctrl+Q` disconnects from
  the current cluster

### Resource Browser

- **Full API coverage**: browse every resource type the cluster API exposes,
  including CRDs
- **Favourites**: pin frequently-used resource types to the sidebar for quick
  access (defaults: Pods, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVCs, Deployments, StatefulSets,
  Services, Ingresses, Namespaces, Nodes)
- **Pinned objects**: pin individual objects to the sidebar to keep them a click
  away
- **Namespace filter**: scope the resource list to one or all namespaces
- **Search**: filter resources by name in real time

### Resource Details

Clicking any resource opens a detail panel with rich, resource-specific
properties:

| Resource                                  | Extra detail shown                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pod**                                   | Per-container state, restart count, image, command, env vars (resolved from ConfigMaps/Secrets), ports, CPU & memory usage vs. requests/limits |
| **Deployment / ReplicaSet / StatefulSet** | Linked pod list with status icons; StatefulSets also show volume claim templates                                                               |
| **Node**                                  | Architecture, container runtime, kernel, kubelet version, OS image, allocatable CPU & memory, pod list                                         |
| **Service**                               | Cluster IP, port list                                                                                                                          |
| **ConfigMap / Secret**                    | Key–value data                                                                                                                                 |
| **PersistentVolumeClaim**                 | Storage class, capacity request, access modes, linked PV                                                                                       |
| **PersistentVolume**                      | Storage class, capacity, access modes, reclaim policy, phase, linked claim                                                                     |

### Metrics

- CPU and memory usage bars are shown inline in the **Pods** and **Nodes** list
  columns (requires metrics-server)
- Per-container CPU and memory usage with requests and limits are shown in the
  pod detail panel

### Logs

- Stream live container logs directly from the resource detail panel
- Each container has a dedicated **Logs** navigation page

### Terminal (exec)

- Open an interactive shell (`/bin/sh`) inside any container from its detail
  panel
- Full VTE-based terminal emulator embedded in the UI (Linux only)

### Port Forwarding

- Forward any container port to `localhost` with a single click from the pod
  detail panel
- Active forwards show the local port; click again to stop

### Resource Editor

- Edit any resource as YAML with syntax highlighting (GtkSourceView 5)
- Inline Kubernetes API reference available while editing
- Create new resources directly from the editor

### Preferences

- **Color scheme**: choose Default, Light, or Dark
- **Cluster settings**: add, remove, or reconfigure clusters at any time
- Preferences are saved automatically to
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/orchestrator/prefs.json`

### Other

- Update notifications: a toast appears when a new release is available
- Crash/panic window catches unhandled errors and displays them gracefully

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Orchestrator connects to Kubernetes clusters using standard kubeconfig files.
Make sure you have a valid kubeconfig at `~/.kube/config` or exported in
`$KUBECONFIG` before launching. Orchestrator will detect all contexts
automatically.

To see CPU and memory metrics, your cluster must have
[metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) installed.

### First Launch

1. Launch Orchestrator. The welcome screen lists all clusters found in your
   kubeconfig.
2. Click a cluster to connect. A spinner indicates the connection attempt.
3. Once connected, the main window opens with the resource sidebar on the left.
4. Use the sidebar to navigate resource types. Click any row to open its detail
   panel.

### Adding a Cluster Manually

1. Open **Preferences** (hamburger menu → Preferences, or the gear icon).
2. In the **Clusters** group, click the **+** button.
3. Fill in the cluster name, host URL, and authentication details (bearer token,
   TLS certificates, or an exec provider).
4. Save and return to the welcome screen to connect.

## Building From Source

### Dependencies

#### Fedora

```sh
sudo dnf install gtk4-devel gtksourceview5-devel libadwaita-devel gobject-introspection-devel glib2-devel vte291-gtk4-devel golang
```

#### Debian / Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libgtksourceview-5-dev libadwaita-1-dev libgirepository1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev-bin libvte-2.91-gtk4-dev golang-go
```

### Build

Generate the embedded icon resource file, then build:

```sh
go generate ./...
go build
```

Run directly without installing:

```sh
go run .
```

### Flatpak Packaging

The Flathub manifest lives at `dev.silkepilon.Orchestrator.yml`. Validate the
desktop and AppStream metadata before submitting updates:

```sh
make flatpak-validate
```

Build or install the Flatpak locally when `flatpak-builder` is available:

```sh
make flatpak-build
make flatpak-install
```

The manifest tracks Go dependencies in `flatpak-go-sources.json` so the Flathub
builder can run without network access during the build.

## Reporting Issues
